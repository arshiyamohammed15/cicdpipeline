# Pre-commit hooks configuration for ZeroUI 2.0
# Install: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
#
# SOLUTION: Single master hook that handles everything
# This completely bypasses pre-commit framework stashing issues and implements
# the desired behavior: auto-fix violations, ask confirmation, never block commits.
#
# The master hook:
# 1. Stages all modified files upfront
# 2. Runs all validations and auto-fixes
# 3. Asks for confirmation before commit
# 4. Never blocks commits (always allows them to proceed)
