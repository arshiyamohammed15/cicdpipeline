# Root Notes Index

The ZeroUI 2.0 repository keeps historical analyses, validation reports, and implementation summaries in `docs/root-notes/` to keep the project root focused on active code. Use this index to find the most relevant references:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` | Deep-dive of CCCS architectural gaps and integration issues. |
| `FIXES_APPLIED_SUMMARY.md` | Summary of critical fixes applied after the comprehensive validation report. |
| `IMMEDIATE_RECOMMENDATIONS_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` | Status report for the highest-priority remediation items. |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Detailed summary of CCCS runtime changes (offline-first, WAL coverage, etc.). |
| `IMPROVEMENTS_VERIFICATION.md` | Line-referenced verification of the improvements listed above. |
| `MARKDOWN_FILES_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` | Audit of Markdown redundancy/duplication with cleanup recommendations. |
| `MODULE_ID_NAMING_RATIONALE.md` | Rationale for EPC vs. M-number module identifiers. |
| `PRE_COMMIT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` | Explanation of the non-blocking pre-commit hook workflow. |
| `REPOSITORY_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` | Cross-module health review (structure, dependencies, security, documentation). |
| `VALIDATION_REPORT_RESUMED.md` | Latest full constitution validation output (large; keep outside the repo root). |
| `Trust_as_a_Capability_VALIDATION_REPORT_FINAL.md` | Historical validation report identifying gaps in Trust as a Capability implementation (all gaps resolved). |

All other PSCL discovery notes remain available in this folder for forensic completeness. When generating new reports, drop them here and update this index rather than cluttering the repository root.
